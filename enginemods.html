          <h2>The Connoisseur of Engine Modifications</h2>
          <p>Showcased is a MK2 Facelift Ford Focus ST. Running at approx 380BHP, this machine is still not upgraded to its full potential. The MK2 Ford Focus ST is a modifiers dream with its vast capability of modifications which is why it is exposed on 100% Ford today. The most complex modification the MK2 ST's have are Block Mods - the method of upgrading the engines internal components to sustain the changes the car went through in factory.</p>
          <p>With modified engines, especially the MK225 ST Engine, the block mod is most relevant due to it’s design with it's open deck and thin cylinder liners. The Focus Mk2 ST225 engine is originally manufactured by Volvo and was fitted to the Volvo T5. The engine already required a block mod but when fitted to the Focus the engine liners had to be made smaller to fit, the engine is a 5 cylinder as opposed to 4 and has a similar sound to V6 type engines.</p>
          <p>Block Mods and engine shims strengthens the areas prone to cracking, and is an ideal piece of mind option especially for those who have spent thousands modifying their cars. During the process the top part of the engine is stripped down to the pistons, the cylinder head is removed along with cams, timing belts, auxillary belts and all tensioners.</p>
          <p>After the work is complete the engine is like new but this then allows the engine to be modified to its full potential.</p>

          <h2>The Changes</h2>
          <p>This is an extensive list of components changed during the block mod process, the process is normally a full days work and for piece of mind all components are replaced with high quality Volvo components:</p>
          <ul style="list-style-type:disc">
              <li><b>Stainless Steel Shims</b> x4</li>
              <li><b>Ford Head Gasket</b> x1</li>
              <li><b>Both aux belts</b> x1</li>

              <li><b>OEM Camshaft seals</b> x2</li>
              <li><b>OEM Turbo manifold gasket</b> x1</li>
              <li><b>Coolant change</b> x1</li>
              <li><b>Oil and filter change, Castrol Edge 0W 40</b> x1</li>
              <li><b>Water pump replaced</b> x1</li>
              <li><b>Head bolts replaced</b> x1</li>

              <li><b>Outer spark plug seals replaced</b> x5</li>
          </ul>
          <p>The process is then finalised by completing a smoke test and full OBD diagnostic. </p>

          <h2>As Jeremy Clarkson would say... SPEEEEEED!</h2>
          <p>Most modern vehicles contain an ECU (or Engine Control Unit) that is effectively a small computer which controls how the engine works. Vehicle manufacturers de-tune the engine by setting the software on the ECU to default before sending the vehicle out. This is done due to the manufacturers having to sell their cars all over the world, this means that the software settings on the ECU must take into account different climates, laws & restrictions and varying quality of fuels. Vehicle remapping is basically the modification/replacement of the manufactures default software on a vehicles ECU.</p>
          <p>A vehicle remap replaces default software on the ECU, overwriting it with new software which can be programmed to optimize the cars overall performance. This is known as vehicle remapping because the ECU is essentially a program that controls how the engine works. When your car is remapped, the tuned software is plugged into your cars OBD port which then overwrites the engine map with the new version to enhance engine performance.</p>
          <p>The MK2 Ford Focus ST Showcased is running with the 'Dreamscience Mod X Remap' which is the most enhanced performance remap currently on the market, increasing the BHP from 225 to approx' 380, more than a standard RS. Alongside an upgraded RS ECU Holder, this machine is razzing at its current max with still more to come.</p>

          <p>You can. There are specialised garages across the United Kingdom which could enhance your Ford like this. The MK2 ST shown was enhanced via <a href="http://www.dreamscience-automotive.co.uk/shop/products/ford-focus-st225-mk2.html"> DreamScience</a> in Hull and worked on this machine vigorously for a full day to make it the car it is today. </p>
