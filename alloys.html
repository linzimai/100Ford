          <h2>The Appreciator Of Alloys & Their Modifications</h2>
          <p>Showcased are various different types of Alloys which will potentially fit your Ford. As you are all lovers of your Fords, you know how much of a difference a good set of alloys will do to your car. The alloys are the limelight of your car which is why they are quite possibly the most important exterior modification you could do- whether its a standard refurb, or a brand new set of gleaming alloys, they will make the difference.</p>
          <p>You don't have to spend thousands upon thousands of pounds to get a clean set of alloys for your Ford. If you have a set of beat up ones then why not give them a refurb? A hot cup of tea, sanding paper and a few cans of paint will do the job! Or, if you want to go the extra mile though, there are multiple Aftermarket Alloys on the market; just make sure the Width, Diameter, Bolt Pattern and Offset are suitable for your car.</p>
          <p>There are multiple different accessories which can come together to make your cars alloys look car show ready and catch the eye of any Ford lover. Represented are Ford Owners alloys where you can gain knowledge, find shops to purchase products and preview other owners shoes.</p>

          <h2>MK2 Focus RS Alloy Conversion</h2>
          <p>Wheel Spacers are the most important part for this conversion process as they allow a perfect fit to the car. If you have a MK2 Ford Focus, this may just be your cup of tea. The process of fitting wheel spacers has many advantages but in certain circumstances have to be fitted to avoid any catching or rubbing inside the wheel arches. The advantages are, improved grip due to wider coverage on the road, improved stability and ride comfort. Wheel spacers also provide a better cosmetic look by making the car look more aggressive and giving it a touring sports car look. As pre mentioned, in certain circumstances it becomes a necessity to fit wheel spacers, this is normally due to alloy wheel upgrades but can also include body modifications.</p>
          <p>For the Ford Focus ST MK2 it is necessary to fit wheel spacers when upgrading from the standard 18” Alloys to Focus RS 19” Alloys. This is due to the extra circumference of the wheel and width plus the size of tyre required. The process is not as simple as changing the wheel and safety procedures must be followed. First you must make sure you have the correct equipment, a good quality trolley jack and axle stands are required.</p>
          <p>Firstly safely jack up the car and remove the standard Alloys then on the inner part of the brake disc, clean off any surface rust with either wire wool, sandpaper and clean down with brake cleaner. Next apply copper grease to the area you have cleaned and on the rear of the wheel spacers, this is to prevent the two surfaces sticking together due to water and dirt ingress. Torque both sets of wheel nuts to the manufacturers specifications and then repeat the process with each wheel. Certain manufacturers such as Ford recommend specific brands, Ford themselves can actually supply Eibach products and they are called a Hub Centric Wheel spacer, this means it perfectly fits around the hub and the studs are tapered to pull the spacer perfectly in line with the cars running gear. This prevents any wheel wobble or damage to components and for safety purposes. Finally carry out a test drive applying full locks to make sure there is nothing catching or rubbing. Check for any steering wobbles or shakes. After your test drive re check all the torque settings on each wheel and repeat  a few days later.</p>
